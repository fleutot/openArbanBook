It seemed more logical to not use relative mode for these exercises and I think that it was a good decision in the long run. It's easier to keep typing the same thing for the note that doesn't change. 

\copyright notice had to be changed to \tagline for the longer exercises with 16th notes

It was decided to put five keys per page for easier reading, and also so that there wasn't just a single spare key on the third page. 

On exercise 4 it was decided to try to be uniform about the use of sharps and flats. In C major I used sharps going up, flats coming down; otherwise stick to the thing that is in the key signature. No double flats or double sharps.
